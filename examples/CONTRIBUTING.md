# Contributing to `toot`

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to toot! This document contains
our contribution policies to help make contributing an easy, enjoyable process.

Please ensure your contributions follow our [code of 
conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Commit message and pull request format

Please format your commit messages as follows:

    <area>: <short description>

    <longer description>

The area should be a single word, and the short description should complete
the sentence "This commit will..."

A longer description should only be entered if necessary.

Pull requests should be formatted the same way. Commits should *not* be
squashed when a pull request is completed. One exception in the pull request
is that it *must* mention a specific issue number. If no issue exists for 
your pull request, please create one first, preferably before beginning work.

Pull requests that don't mention an issue will be automatically rejected. Feel
free to update the description to fix that and re-open the PR.
